Hi! I'm Constantinos.

 A first year PhD student at the [UKRI CDT in Speech and Language Technologies and their Applications](https://slt-cdt.sheffield.ac.uk/), at The University of Sheffield, UK.


Last year, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Behavioral Signals](https://behavioralsignals.com/), a startup aiming to bridging the communication gap between humans and machines by introducing emotional intelligence, from speech, into conversations with AI. I was building speech models and working on MLOps. 

In 2020, I graduated from [School of ECE](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at the National Technical University of Athens, obtaining an Integrated M.Eng. in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My thesis title is "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Natural Language Processing" and my advisor was [Prof. Alex Potamianos](http://www.potam.com).
