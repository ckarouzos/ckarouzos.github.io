[Machines and AI STEM in action school outreach initiative](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/schools-outreach/secondary-schools/stem-in-action/machines-ai/) by Imperial College London and [Semina Mertzani](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/schools-outreach/secondary-schools/stem-in-action/machines-ai/semina---profile/) have included a [profile](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/schools-outreach/secondary-schools/stem-in-action/machines-ai/semina---profile/constantinos-karouzos/) of my work in their website. [Check out](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/schools-outreach/secondary-schools/stem-in-action/machines-ai/semina---profile/constantinos-karouzos/) how I explain my research, my inspiration, my STEM hero and my opinion on the most significant inventions! I'm very happy to be part of this initiative and I hope that this will help to inspire more young people to pursue a career in STEM.
